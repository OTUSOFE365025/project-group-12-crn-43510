# Business Case â€“ AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)

The **AIDAP** system aims to improve communication between institutional data and students, lecturers, and administrators. This is achievable by implementing an AI-driven conversational interface. By combining our AI interface with the current university systems, such as the LMS, registration, and calendar services, **AIDAP** will provide real-time personalized responses to its corresponding queries.

In doing so, it will provide efficiency by reducing staff workload, streamlining information access, and supporting text and voice interactions. It ensures scalability, security, and compliance with institutional privacy policies. The system will be time-efficient and reliable when it comes to displaying data, if certain permissions are met to perform the prompted query.
