| Use Case  | Description | Associated Requirement ID |
| --------- | ----------  | ------------------------- |
| UC-1:     | A student interacts with the system to ask about their class schedule. The system uses AI to interpret natural language queries, receives the data and responds with relevant information using both stored knowledge and live data. | R1, R3, R5, R6, RS1 |
| UC-2:     | A lecturer uses a conversational command to post an announcement. The system checks that the lecturer is authorized, and then sends the announcement to the students in that class. | R5, RL2, RL8 |
| UC-3:     | An administrator monitors system usage through the dashboard, which shows things like health, latency, and errors. The system collects this data from its logged metrics. | RA4, RM2, RM4 |
| UC-4:     | A Lecturer queries the assistant for summarized class analytics such as average attendance or grades. The system checks the Lecturer for authorization, receives the corresponding data, and then displays it | RL3, RL6, R3, R5, R6 |
| UC-5:     | A student receives a notification from the system about a deadline, schedule change, or announcement. The system receives the information from the live calendar, and sends it to the student on their preferred notifications and language | RS2, RS6, R3, R6 |
| UC-6:     | A student uses the assistant to request a consultation or attemd a lecturer's office hour. The system checks the lecturer's availability from the integrated calendar, proposes possible time slots, and books the selected time once both parties confirm. The system then updates both calendars and sends a reminder before the meeting. | RS1, RS3, RL4, R3, R6 |
